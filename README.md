## PrePostValidator - A validation framework for JAVA
### Problem Statement:
When writing code, we oftentimes require validations in place to make sure that the input to a specific function and its output is logically correct. This requires writing a lot of boilerplate code or implementing user-defined interfaces that are tweaked to fulfill certain requirements. Instead of creating these interfaces every time, define a framework for automation of input and output validations.
